# FCAViewTab
Provides the user the ability to carry out Formal Concept Analysis(FCA) from within Protege 3.5 of a Conceptual Graph.

This project uses ideas and source code (in C) taken from the Sourceforge project cgfca (http://sourceforge.net/projects/cgfca/) by 
Dr. Simon Andrews, Sheffield Hallam University (https://www.shu.ac.uk/research/c3ri/people/dr-simon-andrews) together with
ideas from the paper "A Mapping from Conceptual Graphs to Formal Concept Analysis".

Now extended to carry out FCA of Conceptual Graphs imported from a file (CGIF) 
using https://github.com/RichardFallon/CGImport.

To install simply unzip the file; edu.mayo.bmi.fcaviewtab.zip and copy it into the Progege Plugin directory.

For a standalone CG to FCA convertor, which also allows for FCA to CG refer to; https://github.com/RichardFallon/3to2
